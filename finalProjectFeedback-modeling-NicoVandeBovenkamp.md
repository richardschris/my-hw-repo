### ***Final Project - Modeling Analysis Feedback***

***Nico Van de Bovenkamp***

**Overall** Super interesting project! I really enjoyed reading through this and seeing the work you have done with it! Also, great use of Matplotlib for the handy plotting of counts and co-relations with your outcome.

**Some thoughts**

* The only bits that may be missing a bit in your exploratory analysis is relationships within your feature set. Now, given you are using non-linear models mostly, there isn't too much concern, but you may have some redundant features, and opportunity to perform some data transformations.
* Experiment with downsampling! And setting up the class weighting for the random forrest, as well as with other models. You definitely have a cool graph waiting for you to loop through sample weights and plot AUC Scores (or any other metric you'd like).
* Question: How did you deal with NaN values?
* Also, why did you choose to drop all the text data on the complaints? My bet is this could add quite a bit of value to your model.

***I noticed you haven't quite sent in your model draft? We can discuss further on Tuesday!***
