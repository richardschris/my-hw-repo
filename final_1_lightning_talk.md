## The CFPB

The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau is an agency set up in 2011 after the financial crisis to monitor, regulate, and fine companies that violate consumer finance regulations. They've done excellent work curbing bad behavior by lenders and banks, and all complaints are compiled into a publicly available database--there are more than 700,000 complaints in the database.

## Possible Questions

1. There are some differences between complaint rates across states--why? They aren't directly correlated with population (though there is some connection). My hypothesis is that there is some demographic effect--the data we have here alone won't be enough.
2. Can we determine, from the dataset, what factors indicate whether a response will be disputed by the consumer? Only 20% of responses are disputed--why those? I expect that there are strong connections between product, company response, and whether a response is disputed. Perhaps demographics plays into this.
3. Within the CFPB there are some full text complaints. If we drop irrelevant words from them, what do we find? Is there any way we can determine how companies are failing their customers? I assume that we'll find strong patterns indicating deception and extra fees, and I expect that there is enough data that we can find some patterns.
