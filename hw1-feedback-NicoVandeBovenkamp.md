**Overall:**
    Your answers are spot on!

**Something to think about:**
    We don't touch on it too much in class, but think about how you can apply statistical tests to your data. There are many handy tests to determine difference of means (very useful), tests to determine assumptions of an underlying distribution, etc.

***Note: if you ever feel a topic is too elementary, please ask for some suggestions for more advanced readings and I can send things your way (especially once we get into modeling!)***
