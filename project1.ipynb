    "Answer: First, assure ourselves that the data dictionary reflects the dataset. Once we've done this, we need to create a few plots. Create a box plot for the GRE and GPA columns (because admit is either admit/not-admit, and prestige is an integer between 1-4, these columns are not going to have outliers). Determine that the number of admissions is lower than that of non-admissions, and calculate the percentage of admissions. Then we need to calculate the mean/median of the GPA/GRE columns and calculate the standard deviation of those columns, confirming/disconfirming our assumptions about the data and assuring ourselves that the data is representative and diverse enough to conduct analysis on."
