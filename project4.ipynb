We can see this from the coefficients of our regression; the coefficients of prestige=4 is -1.55, indicating that if someone attended a prestige=4 school, their admission odds drop preciptiously."

Furthermore, you can see from the general _shape_ of the lines (plus comparing them together) that GRE and GPA don't have an outsize impact vs prestige--that the shapes are similar, indeed, nearly identical, indicates that GRE and GPA follow the same pattern: they raise your chances of admission, but do not control it. Witness prestige=4 students with high GRE scores and GPAs, whose predicted probability of admission in either chart barely surpasses those of the prestige=1 students with low GREs and GPAs. \n",
